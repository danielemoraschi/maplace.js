It is very flexible so you can easily adjust it to your\nparticular coding guidelines and the environment you expect your code to\nexecute in.\n\n## Reporting a bug\n\nTo report a bug simply create a\n[new GitHub Issue](https://github.com/jshint/jshint/issues/new) and describe\nyour problem or suggestion. We welcome all kinds of feedback regarding\nJSHint including but not limited to:\n\n * When JSHint doesn't work as expected\n * When JSHint complains about valid JavaScript code that works in all browsers\n * When you simply want a new option or feature\n\nBefore reporting a bug look around to see if there are any open or closed tickets\nthat cover your issue. And remember the wisdom: pull request > bug report > tweet.\n\n## Issue Priority\n\n- *P1:* Something is throwing exceptions; broken JSHint backward compatibility.\n- *P2:* Something is not being parsed correctly.\n- *P3:* Features that the core team will work on once P2s and P1s are done.\n- *P4:* Patches welcome; The request is good, but low priority.\n\n\n## License\n\nJSHint is distributed under the MIT License. One file and one file only\n(src/stable/jshint.js) is distributed under the slightly modified MIT License.\n\n## The JSHint Team\n\nJSHint is maintained by [Rick Waldron](https://github.com/rwaldron/), [Caitlin\nPotter](https://github.com/caitp/), [Mike\nSherov](https://github.com/mikesherov/), and [Mike\nPennisi](https://github.com/jugglinmike/).\n\n## Thank you!\n\nWe really appreciate all kinds of feedback and contributions. Thanks for using and supporting JSHint!\n",
